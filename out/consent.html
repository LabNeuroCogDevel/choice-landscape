<p>We are researchers at the University of Pittsburgh doing a research study about
learning and decision making. To accomplish this, we are asking participants to
complete a brief web-based game and to answer a few short questions. The game
involves moving an animated character around your screen to learn where
rewarding items are located. Questions presented at the end include basic
demographic information (for example, your age), feedback about the task (for
example, whether you found it fun or confusing), and information about how you
completed the task (for example, what sort of device you used to respond during
the task). Participation should take under 15 minutes and is completely voluntary.

<h2>What are the possible risks, side effects, and discomforts of this
research study?</h2>
Your participation in this study does not involve any risk to you beyond that of
everyday life. Taking part in this research study may not benefit you personally,
but we may learn new things that could help others.
If you have questions or concerns about the study, you can contact the
researchers by contacting Dr. Beatriz Luna at (412) 383-8167.
If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this research, feel
you have been harmed, or wish to discuss other study-related concerns with

Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) by phone at (412) 383-1480,

<h2>Confidentiality Statement</h2>
<p>Who will have access to identifiable information related to my
participation in this research study?</p>
<p> Your Mechanical Turk Worker ID will be used to distribute payment to you but will
not be stored with the research data we collect from you. Please be aware that
your MTurk Worker ID can potentially be linked to information about you on your
Amazon public profile page, depending on the settings you have for your Amazon
profile. We will not be accessing any personally identifying information about you
that you may have put on your Amazon public profile page. If you decide to
withdraw, data collected up until the point of withdrawal may still be included in
analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to the approved research staff, the following individuals will or may
have access to identifiable information (which may include your identifiable
research record information) related to your participation in this research study:
Authorized representatives of the University of Pittsburgh Research Conduct and
Compliance Office, or The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), may review
your identifiable research information for the purpose of monitoring the
appropriate conduct of this research study.</p>
We might use your research data in future studies. These future studies might be
done by us or by other investigators. Before we use your data, we will remove any
potentially identifiable information. There still may be a chance that someone
could figure out that the information is about you.</p>
<p>To help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality
from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers can use this Certificate to
legally refuse to disclose information that may identify you in any federal, state, or
local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, for example,
if there is a court subpoena. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any
demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below. The
Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of
the United States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally‐
funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the
requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You should
understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member
of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your
involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your
written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use
the Certificate to withhold that information. The Certificate of Confidentiality will
not be used to prevent disclosure to state or local authorities of child abuse and
neglect, or harm to self or others.</p>

<h2>Will I be paid for taking part in this research study?</h2>
<p>Participant(s) that fully complete the online follow-up survey battery will receive
$2.50, based on the expected time to complete the task (15min). Note that MTurk
does not allow for prorated compensation. In the event of an incomplete HIT, you
must contact the research team and compensation will be determined based on
what was completed and at the researchers' discretion.
<b>PLEASE NOTE: This study contains attention checks to make sure that participants
   are finishing the tasks honestly and completely.</b> As long as you read the
instructions and complete the tasks, your HIT will be approved. If you fail these
checks, your HIT will be rejected.</p>

provided information for the purposes described above, you will not be allowed to

consent for participation in this research study will have no effect on your current
