<p>
We are researchers at the University of Pittsburgh doing a research study about learning and decision making. To accomplish this, we are asking participants to complete a brief web-based game and to answer a few short questions. The game involves moving an animated character around your screen to learn where rewarding items are located. Questions presented at the end include basic demographic information (for example, your age), feedback about the task (for example, whether you found it fun or confusing), and information about how you completed the task (for example, what sort of device you used to respond during the task). Participation should take under 15 minutes and is completely voluntary.
