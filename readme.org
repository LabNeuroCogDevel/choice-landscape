* Landscape choice

 * see running version: https://labneurocogdevel.github.io/choice-landscape/
 * aesthetic motivated by [[https://elifesciences.org/articles/59907][Dubois et al 2021 elife]] task: [[https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax/59907%2Felife-59907-fig1-v2.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg][landscape with choices]]
 * task responses recorded at
https://lncdwells.herokuapp.com/testid/habitv1/1/1/

* Hosting

** Heroku
 Using [[./Procfile][~Procfile~]] on heroku w/ ~addon:heroku-postgres~ and https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/psiclj buildpack

* implementation
  
** TODO audio captcha
** TODO parameterize some task settings
    * high prob well is far (yes/no).
    * distribution of sides (high prob more freq?)
    * probabilities
** instructions/state advance
   instructions step through individual actions (sprites, buckets, etc)
** TODO [#A] allow for fixed timing
  scanner will be given explicit onset targets
** update well probabilities on fixed schedule
   currently generated by model.timeline/gen-wells with fixed 20/50 probs
*** add 100/100/100 event
    last event is the test of habit. the far well is no longer effect. can get always get reward from a closer well

** integrated with http server
   POST requests are made before the transition from feedback to iti. intended to be picked up by ~psiclj~ tool/server
** TODO [#B] use full screen
*** zoom body?
    ~translation: scale(1.5)~ works for content but does not scale background.
    with lower wells, maybe less of a problem
*** bigger images?
    bad idea for smaller screens?
*** viewport
https://gist.github.com/bigfive/4256993
~document.body.style.MozTransform='scale(1.1)'~ does not scale background

** DONE [#C] photodiode color block
   tiny block div that changes color at each phase. 
   * Block could be moved to a better location.
   * color range should be imperially checked. have 4 phase alternating between ligth and dark. sensitivity might vary. might need to be bigger

** touch well simulates keypress
   works on wells and instruction button. BUT there is no indication that's what happened.
*** TODO [#C] include :touch true in keypress
    this looks like it'd be hard to integrate
** TODO [#B] set scale of water relative to total points needed
   partially implemented. could still use math to make sure we don't get to 100% until last trial (exp decay?)
** TODO [#C] visual to indicate/collect status history of wells
   not necissary. maybe problematic. would be useful for debugging though
   debugging with probability text over well would be useful too

   bar at bottom with color for success?
   X or O next to the well?
** TODO [#C] arrows
   probably not needed. the buckets are enough of an indication
*** sprites.
   maybe css instead? colored?
*** placement logic
** wells
*** placement logic

    CLOCK: [2021-09-22 Wed 08:06]--[2021-09-22 Wed 09:17] =>  1:11
    :END:
    also fixed a loop bug and stopped animation if active-at is 0
**** exponential decrease. make function to be reused by stepping stones
     hard coded sequence ~:step-sizes~ in atom ~settings/current-settings~ (previously defvar ~BOARD~)

*** set and indicate dis/enabled well
    currently have a bucket on active wells. could still use animations
**** TODO [#C] animate bucket
     have start of animation in wells.svg but crashes inkscape. not critical to task

*** TODO [#C] color icon to distinguish wells
    maybe this isn't needed

** avatar movement

   CLOCK: [2021-09-22 Wed 09:27]--[2021-09-22 Wed 11:43] =>  2:16
   :END:
   had up/down swapped in ~which-dir~. took forever to debug!
   how fast to move? accepting keypress?
** handle key presses
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2021-09-22 Wed 11:57]--[2021-09-22 Wed 12:54] =>  0:57
   :END:
   keypress injected directly into state
*** restrict keypress, don't hard code positions
    instead of restricting, keypress is cleared before we are in ~:chose:~ and waiting for a keypress

** github pages
 useful to share. need ~.nojekyll~ file to use index.html and friends.

** sounds
   copied cash and buz
** feedback
   water fill and sound
*** TODO [#C] maybe add text or stars?
**  ISI/ITI
*** ITI with fixation cross
    may want to change to grayed avatar
**** TODO fixation cross position is different in firefox and chrome
 * maybe prefer chrome instead of firefox.
 * maybe an image will be positioned better?

*** ISI
    * might not need. depends on modeling
    * shake the well for variable time before showing reward
    * intermediate helper goes to the well instead. (bring bucket, drill, etc).
      can be disgruntled or happy
** :done state
   * POST to /finish. Display thank you/finished text
*** TODO [#B] redirect to amazon turk finish page?

** DONE [#C] survey
    * add results to :record, might need to reorganize top level
    * allow text box entry for non-MR (why pick well all at 100%, other thoughts)
** TODO add animation to devcards
   still haven't figured out. but animating for the instruction choice screen helped debug bad frames
** TODO record start and end volume (did anyone turn it down?)

* Debugging
  
** figwheel urls
 * http://localhost:9500/ cards.html
 * http://localhost:9500/figwheel-extra-main/auto-testing
** with repl
