 * see running version: https://labneurocogdevel.github.io/choice-landscape/
 * aesthetic motivated by [[https://elifesciences.org/articles/59907][Dubois et al 2021 elife]] task: [[https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax/59907%2Felife-59907-fig1-v2.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg][landscape with choices]]

* Bugs
** too many buckets 
   can have all 3 wells w/ :open true. probably are not clearing active state correctly?

* implementation
** TODO [#A] instructions/state advance
   want state to be easy to change for instructions step through
   but also for advancing during task
*** allow for fixed timing
   scanner will be given explicit onset targets
** TODO [#A] integrate with http server
** TODO [#B] arrows
*** sprites.
   maybe css instead? colored?
*** placement logic
** TODO [#B] use full screen
*** zoom body?
    ~translation: scale(1.5)~ works for content but does not scale background.
    with lower wells, maybe less of a problem
*** bigger images?
    bad idea for smaller screens?
** TODO [#B] touch well simulates keypress
   would make task usable on a phone
** TODO [#C] visually collect status of wells
   not necissary. maybe problematic

   bar at bottom with color for success?
   X or O next to the well?
** wells
*** placement logic

    also fixed a loop bug and stopped animation if active-at is 0
**** exponential decrease. make function to be reused by stepping stones
     hard coded sequence ~:step-sizes~ in ~model/BOARD~

*** set and indicate dis/enabled well 
    currently have a bucket on active wells. could still use animations
**** TODO [#C] animate bucket
     have start of animation in wells.svg but crashes inkscape. not critical to task

    
*** TODO color icon to distinguish wells
    maybe this isn't needed

** avatar movement

   had up/down swapped in ~which-dir~. took forever to debug!
   how fast to move? accepting keypress?
** handle key presses
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2021-09-22 Wed 11:57]--[2021-09-22 Wed 12:54] =>  0:57

   keypress injected directly into state
*** TODO restrict keypress, don't hard code positions
** github pages
 useful to share. need ~.nojekyll~ file to use index.html and friends.

** sounds
   copied cash and buz
** feedback
   water fill and sound
*** TODO [#C] maybe add text or stars?
** TODO ISI/ITI
   * might not need. depends on modeling 
   * shake the well for variable time before showing reward
   * intermediate helper goes to the well instead. (bring bucket, drill, etc).
     can be disgruntled or happy
** TODO add animation to devcards
