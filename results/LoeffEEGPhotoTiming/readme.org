#+TITLE: Onset Offset adjustment with Photodiode in Status Channel

*  Background

** Status Channel (in recording)
Status channel trigger values include

  - photodiode triggered events (routed through button box). These are always ttl value ~1~
  - those sent by the button box ~2-4~ (RT, initiates "waiting" event)
  - those explicitly sent by the task ~10-230~ (indicating event iti,choice,timeout,waiting,feedback,survey)

See [[file:~/src/tasks/choice-landscape/src/landscape/model/phase.cljs#L96][phase/gen-ttl]].

*** Grouped
They can be grouped like
#+begin_example
     1     2     3     4             % PD, buttons
    10    13    14    15             % iti    (3,4,5 = upcoming choice state)
    23    24    25                   % choice (20 + {3LU, 4LR, 5 UR})
    73                               % timeout
   128                               % start
   163   164   166   167   168       % waiting (state&key +150)
   213   214   216   217   218       % feedback noscore (state&key +200)
   223   224   226   227   228       %     +10 if score (rewarded)
   230                               % finished/survey/catchall
#+end_example

*** State & button
State (choice options: ~Left and Up~, ~left and right~, or ~up and right~) is predetermined.
This state is included in trigger values sent for each event (iti, choice, waiting, feedback).
This can be useful for confirming trigger sequence is expected and no values have been corrupted.

When a choice has been made (left, up, right), that value is also included in the trigger.
Combining state and button push choice distributes 13-18 to the six possible combinations.
That is added to the event (waiting: ~150~ + state&choice [ =163-168= ], feedback: ~200~ + state&choice+reward [ =213-228= ])

| options    | iti | choice | waiting (+150) AND feedback  (+200 +10? ) |    |       |
|------------+-----+--------+-------------------------------------------+----+-------|
|            |     |        |                                      left | up | right |
| left+up    |  13 |     23 |                                        13 | 14 |       |
| left+right |  14 |     24 |                                        15 |    |    17 |
| up+right   |  15 |     25 |                                           | 16 |    18 |

*** Matlab cut

Or as ~discretized~ in matlab
#+begin_src matlab :eval never
cuts = [0,     2,       5,     19,     30,       127,    129,       170,       229,      256];
labs = {'Photo','Button', 'iti','choice','timeout','start', 'waiting','feedback','survey'}
ttl_label = discretize(event_ttl,cuts,labs);
#+end_src

** Task tsv file (external)
The task computer also records it's own history of events into a json file turned into a tsv.
The timing recorded here is expected to be ahead of what is actually displayed due to software (web browser) and hardware (screen refresh rate, wiring) delays.

First onset is the start of the run and of the recording. Baseline all timings to that
#+begin_src matlab :eval never
% adjust to very first iti_onset. and move from ms to seconds
task_time{:,:} = (table2array(task_time) - task_time{1,1})./1000; 
#+end_src

* Combining

We can visualize the three sources of timing information (task computer tsv, task sent triggers, and button box sent photodoide trigger)

or from [[file:example.m]]

* Adjusting
[[file:pd2taskEEGLAB.m]] takes events and moves the onset of the photodoide (ttl=1) onto the appropriate preceding event.
see [[file:example.m]]
