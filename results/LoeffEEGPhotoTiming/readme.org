#+TITLE: Onset Offset adjustment with Photodiode in Status Channel

*  Background

** Status Channel (in recording)
Status channel trigger values include

  - photodiode triggered events (routed through button box). These are always ttl value ~1~
  - those sent by the button box ~2-4~ (RT, initiates "waiting" event)
  - those explicitly sent by the task ~10-230~ (indicating event iti,choice,timeout,waiting,feedback,survey)

They can be grouped like
#+begin_example
     1     2     3     4             % PD, buttons
    10                               % iti
    13    14    15                   % choice
    23    24    25                   % 
    73                               % timeout
   128                               % start
   163   164   166   167   168       % waiting (+150)
   213   214   216   217   218       % feedback noscore, score (+200)
   223   224   226   227   228  
   230                               % finished/survey/catchall
#+end_example


Or as ~discretized~ in matlab
#+begin_src matlab
cuts = [0,     2,       5,     11,     30,       127,    129,       170,       229,      256];
labs = {'Photo','Button', 'iti','choice','timeout','start', 'waiting','feedback','survey'}
ttl_label = discretize(event_ttl,cuts,labs);
#+end_src

** Task tsv file (external)
The task computer also records it's own history of events into a json file turned into a tsv.
The timing recorded here is expected to be ahead of what is actually displayed due to software (web browser) and hardware (screen refresh rate, wiring) delays.

First onset is the start of the run and of the recording. Baseline all timings to that
#+begin_src matlab
% adjust to very first iti_onset. and move from ms to seconds
task_time{:,:} = (table2array(task_time) - task_time{1,1})./1000; 
#+end_src

* Combining

We can visualize the three sources of timing information (task computer tsv, task sent triggers, and button box sent photodoide trigger)

or from [[file:example.m]]

* Adjusting
[[file:pd2taskEEGLAB.m]] takes events and moves the onset of the photodoide (ttl=1) onto the appropriate preceding event.
